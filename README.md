This project consists of displaying binary trees in the Horizontal-Vertical representation.
The proposed program uses an algorithm for calculating the positions of the nodes and edges within a virtual grid with integer coordinates.
This algorithm visits the tree in in-order and makes use of backtracking.
The visualization part uses the D3.js library to draw based on the results of the previous algorithm
